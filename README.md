# Avatar Generator

This project is a simple avatar generator that takes a real image as input and creates an avatar by resizing the image. You can use it to generate avatars for profile pictures or personalization.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2) library
- Google Colab (if you want to run the code interactively)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the code to your local machine.


git clone https://github.com/Aryan1633/avatar-generator.git
cd avatar-generator


2. Place your real image in the project directory and update the `image_path` variable in the code with the filename.

3. Run the Python script to generate the avatar.

```python
python avatar_generator.py
